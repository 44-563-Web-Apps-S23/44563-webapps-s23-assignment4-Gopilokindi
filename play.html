            <h6 class="name DELANE">MRS. DELANE.</h6><p class="speech">here is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.</p>
            <br>
            <h6 class="name QUIRKE">MR. QUIRKE.</h6> <p class="speech">Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising? It
            makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the night-time.
            Going about the country, looking for little stags of sheep, striving to
            knock a few shillings together. That contract for the soldiers gives me
            a great deal to attend to. </p>
            <br>
            <h6 class="name JOYCE">MISS JOYCE.</h6> <p class="speech">He did not, indeed, Mrs. Delane. He has it sticking to him
            yet. Smothering he is in the night-time. The most thing he comes short
            in is the voice.</p>

            <h6 class="name SERGEANT">SERGEANT.</h6> <p class="direction">[_Holding up a placard._]</p><p class="speech">  I brought this notice, Mrs. Delane,
            the announcement of the meeting to be held to-night in the court-house.
            You might put it up here convenient to the window. I hope you are coming
            to it yourself? </p>
            <br>
            <h6 class="name HYACINTH">HYACINTH.</h6> <p class="speech">Good evening to you. I was bid to come to the post-office---- </p>
