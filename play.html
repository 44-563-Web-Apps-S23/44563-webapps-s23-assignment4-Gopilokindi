        <h6>HYACINTH HALVEY  _Lady Augusta Gregory_ </h6>
            <h6>MRS. DELANE.</h6><p>here is the four-o'clock train, Mr. Quirke.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>MR. QUIRKE.</h6> <p>Is it now, Mrs. Delane, and I not long after rising? It
            makes a man drowsy to be doing the half of his work in the night-time.
            Going about the country, looking for little stags of sheep, striving to
            knock a few shillings together. That contract for the soldiers gives me
            a great deal to attend to. </p>
            <br>
            <h6>MISS JOYCE.</h6> <p>He did not, indeed, Mrs. Delane. He has it sticking to him
            yet. Smothering he is in the night-time. The most thing he comes short
            in is the voice.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>SERGEANT.</h6> <p> <p>[_Holding up a placard._]</p> I brought this notice, Mrs. Delane,
            the announcement of the meeting to be held to-night in the court-house.
            You might put it up here convenient to the window. I hope you are coming
            to it yourself? </p>
            <br>
            <h6>HYACINTH.</h6> <p>Good evening to you. I was bid to come to the post-office---- </p>
            <br>
            <h6>FARDY.</h6> <p>I would believe that, indeed.</p>
            <br>
            <h6>MR. QUIRKE.</h6><p>I bade the Widow Early to kill it a fortnight ago--but she
            would not, she was that covetous! </p>
